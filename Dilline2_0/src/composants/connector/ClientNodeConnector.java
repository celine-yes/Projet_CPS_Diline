/**
 * The {@code ClientNodeConnector} class implements {@link RequestingCI} and serves as a connector
 * between clients and sensor nodes within a sensor network. This connector facilitates the execution
 * of synchronous and asynchronous requests from the client to the sensor nodes.
 *
 * <p>It extends {@link AbstractConnector}, leveraging its functionality to connect component interfaces
 * for remote method invocation based on BCM (BIP Component Model) principles. This implementation ensures
 * that requests can be forwarded to sensor nodes effectively, handling both immediate responses and
 * deferred execution through callbacks.
 *
 * <p>Methods implemented:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code execute} - Forwards a synchronous request to the sensor node and returns its result.</li>
 * <li>{@code executeAsync} - Forwards an asynchronous request to the sensor node for processing.</li>
 * </ul>
