/**
 * The {@code RequestResultInboundPort} class provides an implementation for an inbound port
 * that handles results of requests, typically from sensor nodes to a client component in a sensor network.
 * It extends {@link AbstractInboundPort} and implements the {@link RequestResultCI} component interface,
 * providing a mechanism for receiving query results asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>This inbound port is designed to be attached to components that need to process the results
 * of asynchronous requests sent to sensor nodes. It delegates the handling of incoming results
 * to the component's specific implementation, ensuring that results are processed in the proper
 * context of the component's state and logic.</p>
 * @param owner the component that owns this port, expected to be of type {@link Client}
 *              or another component that can handle {@link QueryResultI} objects.
 * @param threadPoolURI the identifier for the thread pool where tasks will be executed,
 *                      allowing for result handling to be offloaded from the main thread.
 *
 * @throws Exception if there is an issue creating the port or setting up its configuration.
